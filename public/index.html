            <h1>Basics</h1>
            <p>Some fundamental concepts to know before continuing</p>

            <h2>Definitions</h2>
            <p>Here we have out general definitions and the meanings behind them</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Electricity: The movement of electric charge(electrons).</li>
              <li>Current: The flow of electric charge(electrons).</li>
              <li>Conductor: Materials that freely allow the flow of an electrical current.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Electricity is the movement of our electrons, current is going to be the flow of the electrons while a conductor is a material that freely allows electrons to flow through it.
              Note that the flow of electrons is the flow of the materials own electrons and not other materials.

            <h1>How is Electricity Produced</h1>
            <p>The general explanation of how we generate electricity</p>

            <h2>Electricity Generation</h2>
            <p>
              Electricity is generated by means of turning a turbine to mve several magnets a cylinder of coiled wire, which produces an electrical current
            </p>
            <div class="turbine-diagram">
              <img>
            </div>
            <p>
              The generation of electrical current from moving a magnet around a wire is described and first observed through Faraday's law of induction
            </p>
            <h2>Faraday's law of induction</h2>
            <p>
              Faraday’s Law of Induction discloses, moving a magnet around a conductor will induce an electrical current. This occurs since the magnetic field of the magnets attracts electrons of the wire, and when moving will attract the electrons in the wire to move with them. This induces a current since there is now a movement of electrons.

            <h1>Applications</h1>
            <p>Examples of how we use electricity as well as how the electricity provides energy to our technologies.</p>
          
            <h2>Light</h2>
            <p>Light is able to be created in a multitude of ways using electricity in various technologies and methods.</p>

            <p>The ways we use electricity to generate light:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Incandescent: electricity heats up metal to create heat that creates light</li>
              <li>Fluorescent: electrons collide with mercury atoms that excite the atoms, bumping electrons to higher energy levels that eventually return to their original energy level by releasing light photons.</li>
              <li>LED: semi conductors cause the current to release energy as photons(light)</li>
            </ul>

            </div>

            <h2>Motor</h2>
            <p>
              A current of electrons also creates a magnetic field as the electrons are in motion, which creates a circular magnetic field since each electron itself is a tiny magnet. This current flow through the rotor which is surrounded has a south and north pole of a magnet going through it. This causes the rotor to spin since the magnetic field of the rotor to oppose the magnetic field of the stationary magnets and cause it to spin since opposite poles repel.
