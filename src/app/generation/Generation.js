            Electricity is generated by means of turning a turbine to move

            electrical current.

            The generation of electrical current from moving a magnet around a
            wire is described and first observed through Faraday's law of
            induction.

          <h2>Faraday's law of induction</h2>
          <p>
            Faradayâ€™s Law of Induction discloses, moving a magnet around a
            conductor will induce an electrical current. This occurs since the
            magnetic field of the magnets attracts electrons of the wire, and
            when moving will attract the electrons in the wire to move with
            them. This induces a current since there is now a movement of
            electrons.
