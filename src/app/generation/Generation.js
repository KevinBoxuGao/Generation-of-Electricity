          Electricity is generated by means of turning a turbine to mve several
          magnets a cylinder of coiled wire, which produces an electrical
          current

          The generation of electrical current from moving a magnet around a
          wire is described and first observed through Faraday's law of
          induction

        <h2>Faraday's law of induction</h2>
        <p>
          Faradayâ€™s Law of Induction discloses, moving a magnet around a
          conductor will induce an electrical current. This occurs since the
          magnetic field of the magnets attracts electrons of the wire, and when
          moving will attract the electrons in the wire to move with them. This
          induces a current since there is now a movement of electrons.
